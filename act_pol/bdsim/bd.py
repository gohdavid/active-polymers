Simulations of active Rouse polymers
------------------------------------

We adapt the `wlcsim.bd.rouse <https://github.com/SpakowitzLab/wlcsim>`_ module developed by the
Spakowitz Lab to perform Brownian dynamics simulations of Rouse polymers driven by correlated,
active noise. Simulations are accelerated using just in
time compilation (jit) using the package Numba.

Provides routines for easily parameterizing Rouse polymer simulations with different types of
noise, deterministic forces, and integrators. Below we summarize the routines most useful for
`Goychuk et al. (2022) <https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.12.24.521789>`_
    1. **with_srk1**: Simulate a Rouse polymer with 1st order SRK integrator. Uses a discrete Rouse
       chain to approximate a semiflexible chain with parameters ``(N, L, b,
       D)``", where :math:`N` is the number of monomers, :math:`L` is the physical
       length of the chain (see note below), :math:`b` is the Kuhn length, and
       :math:`D` is an array specifying the diffusion coefficients of the N monomers.
       If the same value is specified for all N monomers, then we recover equilibrium
       Rouse polymer dynamics.
    2. **identity_core_noise_srk2**: Simulate a Rouse polymer subjected to correlated noise using a
        2nd order SRK integrator. Assign monomers identities (type 1, 0, or -1) such that same
        type monomers are correlated and opposite type monomers are anticorrelated. type 0
        monomers do not experience correlated active forces.
    3. **loops_with_srk1**: Simulate a Rouse polymer with additional Hookean springs connecting
        distinct monomers.

Notes
-----
Our ultimate goal is to apply the Rouse model to the long length scale limit of a semiflexible
chain such as chromatin with persistence length :math:`l_p = b / 2`. Most textbooks parameterize a
Rouse chain by the number of Kuhn segments (defined as ``N`` in Doi & Edwards). Here, we use `N`
to mean the number of monomers in the chain, and instead refer to `\hat{N} = L / b` as the number of
Kuhn lengths in the chain (``Nhat`` in the code). Correspondingly, most textbooks choose the mean
squared extension of the harmonic bonds that make up the Rouse polymer backbone to be `b`. Instead,
we coarse-grain the underlying wormlike chain (WLC) by choosing the mean squared bond extension
of the Rouse chain to be  :math:`\hat{b}^2 = L_0 b`, where :math:`L_0 = L / (N-1)` is the amount of
chain connecting adjacent monomers. This choice corresponds to the mean squared end-to-end
distance :math:`\langle R^2 \rangle = 2Ll_p` of the WLC that connects adjacent monomers.

The Langevin equation for a continuous Rouse polymer, where :math:`s` is the continuous
material coordinate along the polymer backbone is

    .. math::
        \xi \frac{d}{dt} \vec{r}(s, t)
        = k \frac{d^2}{ds^2} \vec{r}(s, t) + f^{(B)}

where :math:`k = 3k_BT/b^2` is the "spring constant" for a Rouse polymer with
Kuhn length :math:`b`, :math:`D` is the "diffusivity of a Kuhn length", i.e. :math:`k_bT/\xi`,
:math:`\xi` is the dynamic viscosity, and :math:`f^{(B)}` is the Brownian force. In order to
dicretize the Langevin dynamics, it can be shown that we must choose the diffusion coefficient
of each monomer to be :math:`\hat{D} = D (N/\hat{N})` (``Dhat`` in the
code). Since :math:`\xi` is in units of "viscosity per Kuhn length" and
:math:`(N/\hat{N})` is in units of "number of monomers over number of Kuhn
lengths", this can be thought of as changing units from "viscosity per Kuhn
length" to "viscosity per bead".

    r"""
    Just-in-time compilable Rouse simulation use 1st order SRK scheme developed by
    A. J. Roberts: https://arxiv.org/abs/1210.0933 (modification of improved Euler
    scheme for SDEs).

    Simulate a Rouse polymer made of N monomers free in solution. Save conformations
    at specified time points (t_save) and calculate the mean squared displacement of all N
    monomers as well as the center of mass MSD at specified time points (t_msd).

    Parameters
    ----------
    N : float
        Number of monomers in the chain.
    L : float
        Length of chain.
    b : float
        Kuhn length of the chain (same units as *L*).
    D : (N,) array_like
        Diffusion coefficient of N monomers. (Units of ``length**2/time``).
        To recapitulate equilibrium Rouse polymer, set D to be the same value for all monomers.
    h : float
        Time step to use for stepping the integrator. Same units as *D*.
    tmax : float
        Total simulation time.
    t_save : (Nt,) array-like
        Time points at which to save output of simulation.
    t_msd : (Nm,) array-like
        Lag times at which to compute MSDs of each monomer + center of mass.
    msd_start_time : float
        Starting time point from which to compute MSD.
    Deq : float
        diffusion coefficient used to compute the spring stiffness, :math:`k/xi =3Deq/b^2`

    Returns
    -------
    X : (Nt, N, 3) array_like of float
        The positions of the *N* monomers at each of the *Nt* time points.
    msds : (Nm, N+1) array_like of float
        Mean squared displacement of the *N* monomers and center of mass at the *Nm* time points

    Notes
    -----
    The Langevin equation for the ith monomers is given by
    .. math::
        \frac{dx(i, t)}{dt} = - \frac{k}{\xi} (x(i, t) - x(i+1, t))
                                  - \frac{k}{\xi} (x(i, t) - x(i-1, t))
                                  + \eta_i(t)
    where :math:`\xi` is the friction coefficient, :math:`k/\xi = 3Deq/b^2` is the spring constant,
    :math:`b` is the Kuhn length of the polymer, :math:`D` is the self-diffusion coefficient of a
    bead, and each spatial component of :math:`\eta_i(t)` is a delta-correlated stationary Gaussian
    process with mean zero and :math:`\langle \eta_i(t) \eta_j(t') \rangle =
    2D_i \delta_{ij} \delta(t-t')`.
    Notice that in practice, :math:`k/\xi = 3D/b^2`, so we do not need to
    include mass units (i.e. there's no dependence on :math:`k_BT`).

    Force calculations, initialization steps, and MSD calculations are in-lined to make code
    as efficient as possible.
